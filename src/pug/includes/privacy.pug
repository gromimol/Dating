                        p Our Policy
                        p.
                            Welcome to TSDMedia OÜ. (“TSDM”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) Privacy Policy. Our services are designed to offer users (collectively, “Users,” “you,” or “your”) the opportunity to meet and contact likeminded individuals for dating and friendship (“Services”). The Services are provided to you through our website (“Site”).
                        p.
                            This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect through the Services, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use, which are available at: www.ts-dating.com
                            By providing us with your personal data when using the Services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.
                        h3 INFORMATION WE COLLECT
                        p When you interact with our Site, we collect information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”)
                        p 1. Personal Data You Provide Us
                        p A. Account Information
                        p Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, location. You may also choose to provide other types of information to make public on the Services, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, your website, and community username.
                        p B. Posts, Following, Lists and other Public Information
                        p The Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Services is information you are asking us to make public.
                        p Your public information includes the (i) messages you post; the metadata provided with such posts, such as when you posted and the application you used to post; (ii) language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and (iii) lists you create, people you follow, posts you mark as likes, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it.
                        p The Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via RSS feeds and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate the Services content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
                        p D. Location Information
                        p We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your TSDM profile and when you set your trend location on the Services. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address.
                        p E. Additional Information
                        p If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting your account on the other service from the Services account.
                        p We also collect information you choose to provide to us when you complete any “free text” boxes in our forms (for example, support request or survey submission).
                        p 2. Information We Receive From Your Use of Our Services
                        p When you use the Services, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:
                        p Log data: Information (“log data”) that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Site when you use it.

                        p Usage Information: We collect information about how you use our Services, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the other Users you interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your activities.
                        h3 HOW WE USE INFORMATION

                        p To authenticate Users and provide the Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract with you.

And that analysis can help us build better Services.
                        p · To conduct research, and provide reporting to third parties;
                        p · If you ask us to delete your data and we are required to fulfil your request, to keep basic data to identify you and prevent further unwanted processing;
                        p · To prevent fraud or criminal activity, misuses of our products or services, and ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture and networks;

                        p Marketing. We may contact you to tell you about services or products we believe will be of interest to you. If we do, where required by law, for example if you are a User in the European Union (“EU”), we will only send you marketing information if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us with your Personal Data. You may opt-out of receiving such emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send you or by updating your user settings. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications, please contact us at support@ts-dating.com.

                        p Targeted Advertisement. TSDM may display targeted advertisements based on Personal Data. Third parties (including ad serving companies) may assume that Users who interact with, view, or click targeted advertisements meet the targeting criteria (e.g., men ages 18–24 from a particular geographic area). TSDM does not provide any Personal Data to the advertiser when a User interacts with or views a targeted advertisement. However, please be aware that by interacting with or viewing an advertisement the third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.
                        h3 SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
                        p We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party service to access your account or when you voluntarily share information or content via the Services. Other Users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you.
                        p There are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law, as set forth below:

                        h3 DATA RETENTION
                        p We will keep your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.
                        p If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.
                        p To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
